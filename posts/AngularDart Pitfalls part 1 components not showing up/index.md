![AngularDart](./1.webp)

So you just started learning how to build Single Page Applications in AngularDart. As you work on the tutorials, you want to create a new component or add some features to the existing ones, but after just 1 edit, the component just disappears!?!

Being shook, you check your "webdev serve" output but it shows that all is working and there are no errors in your window console tooâ€¦ Ugh why did it disappear? Well its most likely because of the below reasons!

You did not set the directives you need to use in the `@Component` decorator!

```typescript
// Example code taken from the "Tour of the Hero" tutorial
@Component(
    selector: 'my-hero',
    templateUrl: "hero_component.html",
    styleUrls: ['hero_component.css'],

    // Note the directives being included below.
    // Always include directives needed in your template!
    directives: [coreDirectives, formDirectives])
```

```html
<div *ngIf="hero != null">
    <h2>{{hero.name}}</h2>
    <div><label>id: </label>{{hero.id}}</div>
    <div>
        <label>name: </label>

        <!-- Note the ngModel directive used below!
             If the directive is not included, it will not work
             and will fail silently instead! -->
        <input [(ngModel)]="hero.name" placeholder="name">

    </div>
    <button (click)="goBack()">Back</button>
</div>
```

## Solution
1. Always remember to set the directives that you need to use in the `@Component` decorator if not the tag in the template wont work!
1. Check if the tag u selected in the selector is correct
1. Note that: The template will just "fail silently" with no warnings or errors shown if the above is not done!
